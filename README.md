### Useful resources

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - The comprehensive guide on CSS by W3Schools significantly enhanced my understanding of styling and layout. The detailed tutorials and examples made it easier to grasp complex concepts, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their CSS skills.
